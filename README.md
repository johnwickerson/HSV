# Hardware & Software Verification

This is the homepage of the above-named module, which is offered to MSc and 4th-year MEng students at Imperial College London.

* The module is run by [Dr John Wickerson](https://johnwickerson.github.io/).

* All coursework is to be done in pairs. Please use [this spreadsheet](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jpw48_ic_ac_uk/EYhkiQ7Q0klGgtWs04hW5cQBj_gjm6j_AlP22WX10hh0Hw?e=ELeDnQ) to support this. The spreadsheet contains two sheets. The first sheet contains students who have already paired up. The second sheet contains students who are still looking for a pair. Please enter yourself initially onto the second sheet, and then once you have found a pair, please move yourselves over to the first sheet.

* All coursework is due at 23:59 on Friday 13 December 2024 (the last day of Autumn term).

* The Isabelle coursework for 2024 is [now available](isabelle/2024).

* The Dafny coursework for 2024 is [now available](dafny/2024).

* The SymbiYosys coursework for 2024 is [now available](yosys/2024).
