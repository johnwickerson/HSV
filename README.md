# Hardware & Software Verification

This is the homepage of the above-named module, which is offered to MSc and 4th-year MEng students at Imperial College London.

* The module is run by [Dr John Wickerson](https://johnwickerson.github.io/).

* Worksheets are available for [Dafny](dafny), [Isabelle](isabelle), and [SymbiYosys](yosys).

* All coursework is to be done in pairs. Please use [this spreadsheet from October 2025](https://imperiallondon.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/elec70056-202510/Shared%20Documents/General/pairings.xlsx?d=we69152f13a3b464f9027c023502c868d&csf=1&web=1&e=opwcVl) to support this. The spreadsheet contains two sheets. The first sheet contains students who have already paired up. The second sheet contains students who are still looking for a pair. Please enter yourself initially onto the second sheet, and then once you have found a pair, please move yourselves over to the first sheet.

* All coursework is due at 15:00 on Friday 12 December 2025 (the last day of Autumn term).

* The Isabelle coursework for 2025 is now available.

* The Dafny coursework for 2025 is not yet available, and is expected to be released by early November.

* The SymbiYosys coursework for 2025 is not yet available.
