# Hardware & Software Verification

This is the homepage of the above-named module, which is offered to MSc and 4th-year MEng students at Imperial College London.

* The module is run by [Dr John Wickerson](https://johnwickerson.github.io/).

* The Isabelle coursework and the Dafny coursework for 2023 are now available -- have a look in the Isabelle and Dafny directories in this repository.

* The SymbiYosys coursework will follow within the next couple of weeks.

* All coursework is to be done in pairs. In Microsoft Teams, I have created a spreadsheet that will help you to pair up.

* All coursework is due at 23:59 on Friday 15 December (the last day of Autumn term), and can be submitted by email.
